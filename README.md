# A project forked from https://github.com/oio/bouncing-band with Variant Launch WebXR support on iOS


Bouncing Band turns any space into a musical instrument. Just use objects and characters from the random orchestra to create music and beats, or just fill the room with chaotic noise.

The experiment runs from a regular website in your browser, without requiring additional downloads or applications to install. Just browse to the project page [https://bouncing.band](https://bouncing.band) from a device that supports WebXR (Chrome Android 81+).

The application lets you drop different sound characters in the surrounding space. Once in the scene, characters will start bouncing off the floors, tables and all the detected surfaces, making sounds as they interact with the environment.

Bouncing Band was built using [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/), starting from the WebXR examples. Under the hood it makes use of the [WebXR device APIs](https://immersiveweb.dev/), of which you can find more information [here](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr/blob/master/explainer.md).

The size of the web application is around 15mb, which is significant for a website but not so much for an AR app considering sounds, images and 3d files. It can be further reduced, as it was not optimised for space.

Bouncing Band performs well up to around 600 bouncing characters, on a Google Pixel 3.

# Develop

```
yarn install && yarn start
```

Https is required by WebXR, you can use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) for https on local dev, there's a handy `yarn grok` command, if you have it installed.
